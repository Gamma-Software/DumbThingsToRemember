# Dumb Things to Remember

This repository list all the dumb things that I encoutered and must be noted on a notepad (this is actually the notepad)

This must be removed

## Docker

### DNS

I installed on my server a DNSÂ resolver. The docker engine parameter must be updated to add the ip of the dns server. In the */etc/docker/daemon.json* file.
``` json
{
  "dns": ["192.168.1.34", "8.8.8.8"]
}
```

### Store the docker images on another partition

Just override the data-root parameter in */etc/docker/daemon.json*
``` json
{
  "data-root": "/mnt/data/docker_images"
}
```

## Bash

### Time your scripts

You can use the `time` command to easily get the execution time of a script.\
For instance you want to know how long it takes to execute this command `ls -l` simply write:
```bash
time ls -l
```
The result will be something like:
```
real	0m0.038s
user	0m0.000s
sys 	0m0.000s
```
More obvious one will be the command `sleep 1`, the result will be:
```
real    0m1,003s
user    0m0,001s
sys     0m0,002s
```

### Time your python scripts

Python scripts can also be timed with the command `time`. For instance, if you want to know how long it takes to execute this command `python3 -c "import time; time.sleep(1)"` simply write:
```bash
time python3 -c "import time; time.sleep(1)"
```
The result will be something like:
```bash
real	0m1.003s
user	0m0.001s
sys 	0m0.002s
```
